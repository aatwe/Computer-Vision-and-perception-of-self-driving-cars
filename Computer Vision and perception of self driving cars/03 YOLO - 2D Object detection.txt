Objective: 2D Object detection

Company: Lyft : 3d object detection & Motion prediction competition
Database --> Self driving car 

What data? Camera data + LIDAR Sensor data



Camera data: 2 cars behind, 2 cars ahead


Lidar data : car is at x

	
What we will work on? Camera images

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

a) 2D Object detection	//Our task

Problem statement: where is object+ what is object


 

b) 3D Object detection

Image + Lidar data --> where 3d object is? return 3d box of object + what it is

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

How to 2D object detection? Algorithm

Problem statement: where is object+ what is object

Which Algo for 2d images? YOLO : You only look once

What is YOLO? Deep learning algorithm
What input? image
What output? object detected
a)How YOLO works?

a) Anchor boxes

b) Intersection Over Union

c) Bounding box prediction



Input image --->   CNN Network   ---> Output Matrix (19x19)

Given matrix (19x19) + vector = [Pc x y  w  h c1 c2 c3]

//What is this vector? What info in a particular cell of Output 19x19 matrix

Pc = if something interesting present/not
if Pc =0 (not intersting)---> other values : x,y,w,h,c1,c2 --> not defined
if Pc =1 (interesting present) --> x,y= centre of box found (object) //wr to given cell
					W = width
					H  = height
					c1,c2,c3 : describe what object in cell


//in below output cell x represents something interesting is present

a.1) Bounding box will be generated
a.2) label will be generated
a.3) probability of box being correct	//accuracy  //there can be multiple bounding boxes each with different probability
		




b) Objective convert multiple bounding box into 1?  Intersection over union(IOU)?
	//Non Maximum suppression

What is IOU?




consider inside bounding box = highest probability
calculate IOU score for other boxes wr to this. How?
b.1) calculate intersection
b.2) divide intersection by their union
b.3) What output?  IOU score		//High IOU = high prob, low IOU = low prob

case1 : single cell high IOU

case2 : single cell low IOU

b.4) for case 3
case3: single cell represents 2 objects	//Solution: Anchor boxes

//extend vector 3 times on cell
//why? 3 anchor boxes in that cell



What is anchor box? rough shape for different objects in 1 cell
How anchor box works? algo
Different type of anchor boxes?
	Square
	Rectangle (V)
	Rectange (H)
What anchor box will do? predict certain specific object
